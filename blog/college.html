    <b>college</b>

    <p><i>i've been asked a lot recently why i'm not in college at 19, opting for the workforce right out of high school. this post is meant to be an exploration of my beliefs, and a sort of answer to that question.</i></p>

    <p>if you dont already know, i've gone straight into the workforce out of high-school, skipping the traditional high-school->bachelors->job or alternative blue collar/apprenticeship route that has become more popular today. i didn't choose to do this just because i tend to be contrarian, but more so because i think that it was the most logical, profitable, and clear cut route availible to me. i'm not going to say that it is the end-all be-all for everyone, but i think people give it a lot less credit it than its worth.</p>
    
    <p>the saying "college is good if youre going to become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. otherwise, it's not worth it." is becoming much more popular, especially among my generation. though i think it misses a lot of detail, it gets the point across: college alone is <i>absolutely</i> not going to prepare you for the workforce, and without lots of supplementation (sometimes even for those roles listed) will not be very useful in showing how valuble or productive you may be for your employment prospects. i think the only reason many people with 'soft' degrees are successful are because they work very hard to supplement their degree with internships and projects, and typically lean on the connections they have made through mentors, parents, and guiding figures. notice, i don't say anything about the education they may have been pitched (in high school) as a one and done solution to get them a job after college (not to mention the cost :/). there are many people i know gliding through these 'soft' degree programs, expecting they will be prepared for the modern-day workforce, and i'm sad to say they will be sorely underprepared and not very marketable.</p>

    <p>i think i caught wind of this at the end of my senior year in high school, and really started searching my options. i remember hearing about one alumni of my hs that had gotten a job in sales (a BDR/SDR role) after an internship during her grad-summer, making nearly six-figures. this sounded completely out of reach, and unreal to me. i reached out to her, and sat down for coffee to hear her story, and it lived up to the hype. i think this was really one of the most pivotal moments in my life so far, and i can only thank her for it. i realized that the "4 year degree" requirement purported by job descriptions all over the world has started to mean nothing. it was really a hollow note at the end of practically every "entry level" job listing, in a weak attempt to fend off unqualified candidates caught in a pipe dream.</p>

    <p>i believe that when you ackowledge this, it makes the risk assesment on your options much easier. for me, it ended up revealing the best way to avoid debt, get a good education, and achieve my dreams (my bucket list items, really) was to dive into the workforce as soon as possible. i would have the opportunity to get real-world experience in a job (employers clearly value that much more than just a degree!), and still keep my option to go to college open, as well as get an apartment, new skis, and things any person would want to have while living "comfortably".</p>

    <p>to folks who were in the same position as me a year or two ago, i will never ever say college is necessary to be successful in todays workforce, and i would even argue that it is marketed predatorily, doing more harm than good to the brightest, most talented of young adults (by no means am i really old enough to say young adults un-ironically). this isn't to say i wont attend college education programs in areas i am passionate about, or believe will <i>legitimately benefit my career</i>, but i will always have a certain disdain for the amount of money and time that is spent in useless, boring classes at colleges that are just looking for a paycheck niave people who can do well without spending 4 years paying to be social.</p>
