<b>my firefox extensions</b>

<p> though I don't think these are essential for everyone, i think these few firefox extensions make my user experience, as well as my traceability on the internet much better. though we are never really untraceable (this is why we have tor, though some will tell you it is backdoored i dont pay them any heed) it is nice to not have "personalized" ads everywhere i go, plauging me like some kind of sick, orwellian joke.</p>

        imagus: makes image viewing much easier on the eyes

        adaptive tab bar color: helps the looks of firefox

        canvas blocker: via browserleaks.com "The Canvas API, which is designed for drawing graphics via JavaScript and HTML, can also be used for online tracking via browser fingerprinting. This technique relies on variations in how canvas images are rendered on different web browsers and platforms to create a personalized digital fingerprint of a user's browser." see https://browserleaks.com/canvas#how-does-it-work and https://browserleaks.com/rects and https://webtransparency.cs.princeton.edu/webcensus/#audio-fp

        clearurls: many websites use tracking elements in the URL (e.g. https://example.com?utm_source=newsletter1&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=sale) to mark your online activity. all that tracking code is not necessary for a website to be displayed or work correctly and can therefore be removed.

        font fingerprint defender and webgl fingerprint defender: in the same vein here as canvas blocker, these defend against fingerprinting by websites essentially built-into the javascript by recognizing unique attributes about how my device displays/loads data on the website. see https://browserleaks.com/webgl for more info

        ubypass: essentially 12ft.io (i believe 12ft.io has been taken offline, but there are many alternatives found by a quick google search), but in a web extension format. the purpose here is to bypass paywalls that news sites like WSJ instate on their articles. its super useful when doing research for papers and such.

        ::marker
        temp mail: gives you a temporary email to use for websites you dont want spam from, or don't want to connect to your online identity. i personally have used it a handful of times on walmart.com because of their notorius tracking/data collection.

        unhook: ive grown to love extensions like these that remove aspects of youtube that have become somewhat predatory. the philosiphy behind this is based upon cal newtons "Digital Minimalism" - essentially i want to minimize the use of my electronic 'smart' devices for entertainment, and transform them into tools. this extension can be configured to hide my home page, reccomendations, comments, etc. from youtube, keeping my (valuble) attention on the topic i came to youtube for.
